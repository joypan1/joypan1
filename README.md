- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joy Pan, a current senior in high school.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in studying either computer science or an engineering field.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (Harvard's CS50P), the web development trio (HTML, CSS, Javascript - The Odin Project), and becoming accustomed to Git and Github. I have general familiarity with C++ and I know Java core concepts.

  I have not yet deeply studied mathematics like linear algebra and other fields related to computer science, and I am not currently familiar with the more complicated topics within computer science (i.e. algorithms)
